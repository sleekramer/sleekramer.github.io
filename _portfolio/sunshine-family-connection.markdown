## Summary

Civic application built for the City of Saint Petersburg Youth Council for connecting families in need with service providers in the area. I volunteered my time to contribute to this project as a fullstack developer. This application is still in development, after being kickstarted during the National Day for Civic Hacking. Most recently, I was one of two team members to present our current work to the City Council of Saint Petersburg, FL.

## Explanation

Sunshine Family Connection is a portal for families, parents, children, care providers, or anyone else in need to find the services that they require. Service providers are required to apply for registration with the site in order for their business to be featured.  Our users are then able to easily reach out to the various services, using the verified information that we have aggregated.

## Features

* Providers can register for an account with the site by providing their credentials and contact information, as well as an accurate description of their business or organization. This information is to be verified by an admin.
* Users can search for providers by the type of service they provide or by name.
* Users can contact providers and request their services, while never passing their personal information to our database.
