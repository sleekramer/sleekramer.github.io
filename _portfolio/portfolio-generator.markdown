## Summary

Portfolio Generator offers a simple solution to creating an online portfolio. Users simply need to sign up for an account and they will have a portfolio pre-generated for them. With a simple to use interface, the user is able to add the desired information about themselves and their past work.

## Explanation

While completing my Fullstack Developer apprenticeship with Bloc, I discovered that there is a lot of resistance from developers, and other creative professionals, toward building a portfolio site to showcase their work.  As one of my capstone projects, I decided to build Portfolio Generator to take the hassle out of creating a portfolio from scratch.

## Features

* Users can register for an account
* Users can add and edit their personal information, such as their name and skill set
* Users can link to an un-editable version of their portfolio
* Projects can be added and updated dynamically with write-ups and images
